## Why YouTube Enhanced Theater?

If you’re rocking an ultra-widescreen monitor, you’ve probably noticed that watching YouTube videos in fullscreen mode leaves much to be desired: black bars on the sides, wasted screen space, and a viewing experience that doesn’t take full advantage of your display. **YouTube Enhanced Theater** fixes this by:

- Maximizing the video player within your browser window.
- Preserving the video’s aspect ratio for a crisp, proportional view.
- Delivering an immersive, theater-like experience tailored to your ultra-widescreen setup.

Say goodbye to the limitations of fullscreen mode and hello to a viewing experience that truly shines on your monitor! 🌟

## ✨ Key Features

- **Maximized Video Player**: Expands the YouTube video player to fill your browser window, making the most of your ultra-widescreen real estate without stretching or cropping the video.

- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Keeps your videos looking sharp and proportional, optimized for ultra-widescreen displays.

## 🛠️ How It Works

YouTube Enhanced Theater builds on YouTube’s built-in theater mode, supercharging it with custom styles and behaviors. When you activate it, the extension:

1. Switches YouTube to theater mode.
2. Hides non-essential elements like the header, sidebar, and comments.
3. Resizes the video player to fit your entire browser window, keeping the video centered and proportional.
4. Adapts dynamically as you resize your window, ensuring the video always looks its best.

It’s lightweight, reliable (with a retry mechanism for slow-loading pages), and designed to make your ultra-widescreen monitor shine. 💡
